# Swift Eco-System

## A simple enterprise eco-system(iPhone-Server-Mac) . This is a basic restaurant system using iOS app as client, Vapor Swift as server and macOS app as admin, built completely with swift.
### I built this just to discover and demonstrate what is possible with swift. As such, you may find that the project lacks many features of an actual enterprise system, as it obviously isn’t. Thank you. 

Here are its 3 components:

The Server:
[GitHub - mdsahilak/RestaurantServer: A Vapor swift backend server for a restaurant’s Ordering, Admin, Kitchen and Billing Aspects.](https://github.com/mdsahilak/RestaurantServer)

The iOS App:
[GitHub - mdsahilak/RestaurantClient: A restaurant iOS app for ordering in a restaurant.](https://github.com/mdsahilak/RestaurantClient)

The Mac App:
[GitHub - mdsahilak/RestaurantAdmin: A restaurant Mac app for adminstration of a restaurant](https://github.com/mdsahilak/RestaurantAdmin)



Thank you.
