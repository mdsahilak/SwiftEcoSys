# Swift Eco-System

## A simple enterprise eco-system(iPhone-Server-Mac) . This is a basic restaurant system using iOS app as client, Vapor Swift as server and macOS app as admin, built completely with swift(except for the websites obviously, I used the leaf templating language from the wonderful folks at Vapor for that).

### This is a small side project that i built to explore what is possible with swift. As such, you may find that the project lacks many features of an actual enterprise system, as it obviously isnâ€™t. Please forgive Architectural Quality of the Code as this project was hacked together just for exploring and haven't been refactored extensively or optimized.
