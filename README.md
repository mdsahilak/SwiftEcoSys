# Swift Eco-System
---
## A simple enterprise eco-system(iPhone-Server-Mac) . This is a basic restaurant system using iOS app as client, Vapor Swift as server and macOS app as admin, built completely with swift(except for the websites obviously, I used the leaf templating language from the wonderful folks at Vapor for that).
---
### I built this just to discover and demonstrate what is possible with swift. As such, you may find that the project lacks many features of an actual enterprise system, as it obviously isnâ€™t. Also, please forgive the code and architectural quality as I am new to programming and this is a beginners project.

Here are its 3 components:

The Server:

The iOS App:

The Mac App:
