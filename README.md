Swift EcoSys
- - - -
## A simple enterprise eco-system(iPhone-Server-Mac) . This is a basic restaurant system using iOS app as client, Vapor Swift as server and macOS app as admin, built completely with swift.
### I built this just to discover and demonstrate what is possible with swift. As such, you may find that the project lacks many features of an actual enterprise system, as it obviously isnâ€™t. Thank you. 

Here are its 3 components:

The Server:

The iOS App:

The Mac App:


Thank you.
